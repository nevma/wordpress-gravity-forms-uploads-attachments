# WordPress Gravity Forms uploads attachments

Usually, when a WordPress Gravity Form contains file upload fields (single or multiple), then, when this form is submitted by front-end users, the files which have been uploaded along with the form are kept in a directory inside the WordPress installation. With this plugin they will also be included as email attachments into the notification emails that have been configured for each form. 



## Installation 

Just like any other WordPress plugin, only you have to upload it manually in the plugins folder. Use the master branch for this. 

You can also install it via the [Github Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) plugin. 



## Updates

The plugin is hosted in Github, so, in order for it to be able to be updated automatically, you need to install the [Github Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) plugin. 



## Settings

This plugins works in the background for all notifications of all forms as soon as it is activated. 

Some flags and hardcoded settings will eventually be provided in order for the developer to be able to adjust the plugin behaviour.
